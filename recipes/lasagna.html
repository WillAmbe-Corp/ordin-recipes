        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p><li><strong>step1</strong></li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat: cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p><br>

        <p><li><strong>Step3</strong></li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p><br>
        <p><li><strong>Step4</strong></li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p><br>

        <p><li><strong>Step6</strong></li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p><br>
        <p><li><strong>Step7</strong></li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p><br>
