    <p class="introduction">Here's what you'll need to make the best, crispiest fried chicken of your life:</p>
    <div class="main-item">
    <ul>
        <li class="item">Chicken: </li><p> Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or things at the grocery store.</p>
        <li class="item">Buttermilk: </li><p>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken</p>
        <li class="item">Flour: </li><p>All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust</p>
        <li class="item">Seasonings: </li><p>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</p>
        <li class="item">Oil: </li><p>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point</p>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="head">Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 1</strong></li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</p>
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 2</strong></li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken)</p><br>

        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 3</strong></li> Dip chicken in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</p> <br>
        <img src="./images/crispy 3.webp" height="250" width="250" alt="chicken mixed with flour">
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 4</strong></li> Place the coated chicken on the cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</p><br>
        <img src="./images/Crispy 4.webp" height="250" width="250" alt="coated chicken">
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 5</strong></li> Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</p><br>
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 6</strong></li> Put in as many pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides</p><br>
        <img src="./images/Crispy 5.webp" height="250" width="250" alt="Chicken in HOT oil">
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 7</strong></li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</p><br>
        <p><li><strong class="step">Step 8</strong></li>Drain the fied chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</p><br>

        <h2>How to Store Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>Let the fried chicken cool before storage to prevent bacteria growth. Place it in a shallow airtight container or wrap it tightly in aluminum foil, then refrigerate for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or in the oven</p>
